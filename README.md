📌 Assumptions & Design Choices  
  
•The app assumes users will input valid city names.  
•The UI is kept minimal and responsive for better user experience.  
•API requests are made directly from the frontend for simplicity.  
•Error handling is basic (e.g., shows a message for invalid city or network issues).
